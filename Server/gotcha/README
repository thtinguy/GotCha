Gotcha App - Back-end
=================================

1) Introduction

This part of the project takes care of all of the back-end needs of the application. The goal is to create a RESTful API
and have the application communicate with it.

- This backend uses the version 2.4 of the Play Framework in Java : https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/Installing
- For hosting we will use Heroku : https://www.heroku.com
- In terms of database and object persistence, we use the Ebean ORM which integrates with javax.peristence annotations : https://ebean-orm.github.io/quickstart
- For the actual deployment database, as we are using Heroku we will use the integrated PostgreSQL database already hosted by Heroku : https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/play-support

2) Running on your local host

Here is how to have the server running on your localhost:

- Download the latest version of the typesafe activator : https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/Installing
- Make sure you are running a version >= 1.8 of the JDK as Play 2.4 has stopped support for older versions of Java
- Open a command line instance and navigate to the root of the project
- Start activator by typing : activator
- Once activator has started up, you should now be in the activator REPL
- To start the application type : run
- The HTTP server should now be listening on the localhost port 9000
- To access the application open up your web browser and type : localhost:9000
- The application on first time start up will ask you to apply the database script which you can accept by clicking : apply script
- The server is now listening up and running !

3) Basic API description 

Here are the temporary functionalities provided by the server:

- The root url(localhost:9000) contains a simple html form which can be used to create simple items
- The search form is very basic, and can be used to look for an Item with the keyword matching the name of the object. Results are returned as JSON
- A call to localhost:9000/item/json will return all current Items as JSON

4) Running Tests

Here is how to run the test suite on your code. This functionality should be used
to check if after modifying something you have not broken any tests.

- Navigate to the server root directory
- To run the tests type: activator test
- This should display the test results shortly after running all of them
